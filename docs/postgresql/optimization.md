# PostgreSQL Performance Optimization Documentation

## Overview

This document details PostgreSQL-specific optimizations implemented to enhance the performance of our educational data analysis system. The optimizations leverage PostgreSQL's advanced features, including materialized views, parallel query processing, and sophisticated indexing strategies.

## Parallel Processing Configuration

The system has been configured to utilize parallel query execution:

```sql
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
```

This setting enables PostgreSQL to distribute query workload across multiple CPU cores, significantly improving performance for complex analytical queries.

## Materialized Views Implementation

### Student Enrollment Status
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_unenrolled_students AS
```
This view maintains a pre-computed dataset of unenrolled students, including:
- Personal identification information
- Geographic location details
- Normalized postal code data for distance calculations

### Center Location Data
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_centre_locations AS
```
This view provides rapid access to:
- Center identification information
- Geographic coordinates
- Standardized postal codes for proximity calculations

### Center Saturation Analysis
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_centre_saturation AS
```
This view pre-calculates key metrics including:
- Total student count per center
- Enrollment statistics
- Average subject load calculations

### Subject Enrollment Statistics
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_enrollment_subjects AS
```
This view maintains:
- Subject-specific enrollment counts
- Center-wise distribution data
- Pre-aggregated student statistics

## Index Optimization Strategy

The system implements a comprehensive indexing strategy:

### Materialized View Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_unenrolled_cp_num ON mv_unenrolled_students(cp_num);
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_centre_cp_num ON mv_centre_locations(cp_num);
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_centre_saturation_students ON mv_centre_saturation(total_students DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_enroll_subject ON mv_enrollment_subjects(nom_assignatura);
```

These indexes are designed to optimize:
- Geographic proximity calculations
- Enrollment count retrievals
- Subject-based queries
- Sorting operations

## Query Performance Enhancements

### Center Recommendation System
The system employs PostgreSQL-specific optimizations:
- Recursive CTE with materialization
- Lateral joins for improved performance
- Early filtering of distance calculations
- Efficient partitioning for student-center matching

### Data Maintenance

A dedicated function manages materialized view refreshes:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_materialized_views()
```

This function enables:
- Concurrent refresh operations
- Automated maintenance scheduling
- Minimal impact on system performance during updates

## Implementation Guidelines

To maintain optimal performance:

1. Schedule regular materialized view refreshes during off-peak hours
2. Monitor parallel query execution effectiveness
3. Regularly analyze index usage patterns
4. Validate query execution plans after data volume changes

## Performance Considerations

The optimizations provide significant benefits but require attention to:
- Storage requirements for materialized views
- Memory allocation for parallel query execution
- Index maintenance overhead
- Refresh timing and frequency

These optimizations substantially improve query response times while maintaining data accuracy and system reliability. Regular monitoring and maintenance ensure sustained performance benefits.

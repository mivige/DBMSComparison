# SQL Queries Migration Documentation 

## Overview
This documentation covers the adaptation of educational data analysis queries for PostgreSQL compatibility. The queries maintain their original analytical objectives while incorporating PostgreSQL-specific syntax and optimizations.

## Query Transformations

### Professional Training Enrollment Analysis
The query examining Professional Training course enrollments remains unchanged, demonstrating strong cross-database compatibility. It effectively:
- Counts unique students per center
- Links educational centers with enrollment data
- Filters specifically for Professional Training courses

### Center Saturation Analysis
The saturation analysis query includes a minor but significant modification for PostgreSQL compliance:
```sql
ROUND(COUNT(e.subject_id)::numeric / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT e.dni), 0), 2)
```
This adaptation ensures proper decimal division and null handling in PostgreSQL while maintaining the original analysis objectives:
- Student count per center
- Total enrollment figures
- Average subject load per student

### Low Enrollment Subject Analysis
The query identifying subjects with fewer than four enrollments maintains its structure, demonstrating PostgreSQL compatibility without modifications. The analysis continues to provide:
- Subject identification
- Associated center details
- Precise enrollment counts
- Proper ordering for analysis

### Unenrolled Student Identification
Both the detailed student list and count queries remain unchanged, indicating robust cross-database compatibility. These queries continue to:
- Identify students without enrollments
- Provide comprehensive student details
- Include geographical information
- Maintain efficient LEFT JOIN operations

### Center Recommendation System
This query required the most significant PostgreSQL-specific modifications:

```sql
CAST(us.student_cp AS INTEGER) - CAST(l.CP AS INTEGER)
```

Key changes include:
- Replacement of MySQL's SIGNED type with PostgreSQL's INTEGER
- Maintained complex ranking logic using window functions
- Preserved geographical proximity calculations
- Enhanced result ordering for better readability

## Technical Considerations

### Data Type Compatibility
The migration highlights important differences in data type handling:
- Numeric casting syntax variations
- Integer type specifications
- Null handling mechanisms

### Query Performance
The PostgreSQL implementation maintains performance optimization through:
- Efficient use of CTEs
- Proper indexing opportunities
- Strategic join ordering
- Early filtering where possible

### Maintenance Requirements
To ensure continued performance:
- Regular index maintenance
- Statistics updates
- Query plan monitoring
- Performance validation with varying data volumes

## Implementation Guidelines
When implementing these queries:
1. Verify index creation on relevant columns
2. Monitor query execution plans
3. Validate numeric calculations
4. Ensure proper handling of null values

The migration demonstrates robust SQL fundamentals while accommodating PostgreSQL-specific requirements, ensuring reliable educational data analysis capabilities.
